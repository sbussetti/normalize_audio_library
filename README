normalize_audio_library

This is still a very much experiemental script.  The design methodology errs very much on the side of caution for your files.  Losing audio is highly unlikely, but other side effects are possible.  Use at your own risk.

Help:
    normalize_audio_library.pl

    I am using a crummy old options library and arguments are processed positionally.
    Directory options must all preceed processing options.
    Usage: normalize_audio_library.pl [DIRECTORY OPTIONS] [PROCESSING OPTIONS]

     -h, --help                  prints this message

    Directory Options
     -s, --search_dir=DIR        where your files to be organized live
     -r, --root_dir=DIR          where your organized files will live; if not specified
                                 process is done in-place
     -b, --backup_dir=DIR        the script makes backups for certain transforms; they go
                                 here
     -t, --total_files=INT       in case you already know and don't want to wait for it
                                 to rescan total

    Processing Options
     -n, --normalize_paths       clean up
     -i, --locate_lowres_images  scans for your normalized folder.jpg files and complains
                                 if they are low resolution
